**General Security Concepts**

**Compare and contrast various types of security controls.**

* **Categories of Security Controls**  
  * **Technical Controls**  
    * These involve hardware or software mechanisms designed to protect systems and data (e.g., Firewalls, IDS, encryption protocols).  
  * **Managerial Controls**  
    * Policies and procedures established by an organization's management to guide security efforts (e.g., Risk assessments, security planning, resource allocation).  
  * **Operational Controls**  
    * Day-to-day procedures and practices that ensure security policies are effectively implemented (e.g., User training programs, incident response protocols, regular data backups).  
  * **Physical Controls**  
    * Measures taken to protect the physical infrastructure and assets of an organization (e.g., Security guards, surveillance cameras, access control systems).

* **Types of Security Controls**  
  * **Preventive Controls**  
    * Aim to stop security incidents before they occur (e.g., Access control mechanisms, security policies, antivirus software).  
  * **Deterrent Controls**  
    * Designed to discourage potential attackers from initiating harmful actions (e.g., Warning signs, visible security cameras, legal disclaimers).  
  * **Detective Controls**  
    * Intended to identify and alert about security incidents as they happen or after they have occurred (e.g., Log monitoring, IDS, security audits).  
  * **Corrective Controls**  
    * Focus on restoring systems and data after a security breach or incident (e.g., Data restoration from backups, system patches, incident response procedures).  
  * **Compensating Controls**  
    * Alternative measures implemented when primary controls are not feasible or fail to provide sufficient protection (e.g., Increased monitoring when segregation of duty isn’t possible, additional authentication methods).  
  * **Directive Controls**  
    * Establish expected behaviors and actions through policies or guidelines (e.g., Acceptable use policies, security awareness training, standard operating procedures).
