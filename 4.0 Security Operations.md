  * **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) Logs**  
    * Monitor network or system activities for malicious actions or policy violations, providing alerts and details about potential threats. They are essential for real-time threat detection and response.  
  * **Network Logs**  
    * These logs capture data on network traffic, including source and destination IP addresses, protocols used, and data transfer details. They help in analyzing communication patterns and identifying unusual or unauthorized activities.  
  * **Metadata**  
    * Metadata provides contextual information about data, such as timestamps, file sizes, and creation dates. In investigations, metadata can help establish timelines and understand the characteristics of data involved in an incident.

* **Additional Data Sources**  
  * **Vulnerability Scans**  
    * Regular scans identify known vulnerabilities within systems and applications. The results guide investigators in understanding potential exploitation paths used by attackers.  
  * **Automated Reports and Dashboards**  
    * These tools aggregate and present data from various sources, offering a consolidated view of security metrics and incident statuses. They aid in monitoring trends and quickly assessing the security posture.  
  * **Packet Captures**  
    * Packet capturing involves recording network traffic data packets for analysis. This data is crucial for deep-diving into network communications to identify malicious activities, data exfiltration, or unauthorized access.
